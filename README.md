Meal Madness. How it works: the application pulls 8 businesses within the user's criterion and puts them into a bracket. 
Each restaurant competes with each other to earn the user's patronage. 
Every round more information is displayed about the businesses, including reviews, price, location and a map.
The reviews displayed from round to round change, so each restaurant needs 3 good reviews in a row for a fighting chance.
Go Zags!
